# Starry Night Reflection Ocean Shader

## *Description*

A project including a custom GLSL shader that simulates waves with real-time reflection of a star-filled night sky. Created as part of a graphics course to explore techniques in GLSL shader coding, animation, and reflection logic.

## *Features*

- Animated trig. wave surface manipulation
- Procedural sky reflection
- Adjustable GUI (hidden in production) for wave management

## *Tech Stack*
- GL Shading Language
- JavaScript
- WebGL/Three.js
- Vite

## *Key Takeaways*

- Animation of vertices in GLSL for realistic motion
- Reflection and refraction work in shaders (harder than it looks!)
- Combining noise functions with known trig for natural visuals
- Utilization of uniforms to pass data to shaders

## *License*

This project is available under the MIT License, open source.
